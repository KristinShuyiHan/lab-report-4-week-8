# CSE15L Lab Report 4

## links 

 The link of MarkdownParse Repos
 
[mine](https://github.com/KristinShuyiHan/markdown-parse)

[reviewed in Wk7](https://github.com/zfxd/markdown-parse)

## Snippet 1:

```
`[a link`](url.com)

[another link](`google.com)`

[`cod[e`](google.com)

[`code]`](ucsd.edu)
```
output generated by the CommonMark demo site:

Becuase the backtick in front of the first link violates the link syntax, every link except the first is a valid link, so we should expect: **[`google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]**

Turing the snippet into a test case, and saved as `Snippet1.md`
```
 @Test
    public void testSnippet1() throws IOException{
        Path fileName = Path.of("Snippet 1.md");
	    String contents = Files.readString(fileName);
        List<String> expected = List.of("`google.com", "google.com", "ucsd.edu");
        assertEquals(expected, MarkdownParse.getLinks(contents));
    }
```
My implementation of `MarkdownParse.java` fails the test by picking up the invalid link and misses the last valid link:
```
Time: 0.023
There were 3 failures:
1) testSnippet1(MarkdownParseTest)
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<[`google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]> but was:<[url.com, `google.com, google.com]>
        at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:89)

        at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:146)
        at MarkdownParseTest.testSnippet1(MarkdownParseTest.java:40)
```


Implementation of `MarkdwonParse.java` from other hroup also fails the test by preceiving every link as valid link:
```
Time: 0.021
There were 3 failures:
1) testSnippet1(MarkdownParseTest)
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<[`google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]> but was:<[url.com, `google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]>

**Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.**

## Snippet 2:

```
[a [nested link](a.com)](b.com)

[a nested parenthesized url](a.com(()))

[some escaped \[ brackets \]](example.com)
```
output generated by the CommonMark demo site:

Becuase content inside the first bracket follows the syntax of link, the first link is fine.
Second link works because cotent in both beracket and parenthesis is complete by following the syntax.
COntetn in first set of bracket and praenthsis follows the syntax of valid link, so the third link works. Thus, we should expect: **[a.com, a.com(()), example.com]**

Turing the snippet into a test case, and saved as `Snippet2.md`
```
@Test
    public void testSnippet2() throws IOException {
        Path fileName = Path.of("Snippet2.md");
        String contents = Files.readString(fileName);
        List<String> expected = List.of("a.com", "a.com(())", "example.com");
        assertEquals(expected, MarkdownParse.getLinks(contents));
    }
```
My implementation of `MarkdownParse.java` fails the test, pinking only the second link with normal ()[] format, and also fails to identify the right bracket of the url:
```
2) testSnippet2(MarkdownParseTest)
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<[a.com, a.com(()), example.com]> but was:<[a.com((]>
        at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:89)
        at org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:835)
        at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:120)
        at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:146)
        at MarkdownParseTest.testSnippet2(MarkdownParseTest.java:48)

```

Implementation of `MarkdwonParse.java` from other hroup also fails the test by faling to identify a complete link in second link:
```
2) testSnippet2(MarkdownParseTest)
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<[a.com, a.com(()), example.com]> but was:<[a.com, a.com((, example.com]>
        at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:89)
        at org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:835)
        at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:120)
        at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:146)
        at MarkdownParseTest.testSnippet2(MarkdownParseTest.java:25)
```

**Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.**

## Snippet 3:

```
[this title text is really long and takes up more than 
one line

and has some line breaks](
    https://www.twitter.com
)

[this title text is really long and takes up more than 
one line](
    https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/
)


[this link doesn't have a closing parenthesis](github.com

And there's still some more text after that.

[this link doesn't have a closing parenthesis for a while](https://cse.ucsd.edu/



)

And then there's more text
```
output generated by the CommonMark demo site:

Becasue there can not be an line in [] and (), only the second link is valid, so we should expect: **[https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/]**

Turing the snippet into a test case, and saved as `Snippet3.md`
```
@Test
    public void testSnippet3() throws IOException {
        Path fileName = Path.of("Snippet3.md");
        String contents = Files.readString(fileName);
        List<String> expected = List.of("https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/");
        assertEquals(expected, MarkdownParse.getLinks(contents));
    }
```
My implementation of `MarkdownParse.java` fails the test by falsely picking but both second and third link:
```
3) testSnippet3(MarkdownParseTest)
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<[https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/]> but was:<[
    https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/
, github.com

And there's still some more text after that.

Implementation of `MarkdwonParse.java` from other hroup also fails the test by picking up all the links:
```
